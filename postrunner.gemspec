  spec.description   = %q{PostRunner is an application to manage FIT files
such as those produced by Garmin products like the Forerunner 620 (FR620) and
Fenix 3 or Fenix 3HR. It allows you to import the files from the device and
analyze the data. In addition to the common features like plotting pace, heart
rates, elevation and other captured values it also provides a heart rate
variability (HRV) analysis. It can also update satellite orbit prediction
(EPO) data on the device to speed-up GPS fix times. It is an offline alternative
to Garmin Connect. The software has been developed and tested on Linux but
should work on other operating systems as well.}
